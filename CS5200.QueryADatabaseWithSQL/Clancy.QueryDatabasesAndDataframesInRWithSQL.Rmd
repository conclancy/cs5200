```{r}
library(RSQLite)
library(sqldf)

fpath = getwd()
dbfile = "/MediaDB.db"

dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), paste0(fpath, dbfile))
```

# Question 1
```{r}
rs <- dbGetQuery(dbcon, "SELECT * FROM invoice_items")
head(rs)
```

```{r}
rs$ItemPrice <- rs$UnitPrice * rs$Quantity
head(rs)
```

```{r}
round(mean(rs[['ItemPrice']], trim=.01), 2)
```

# Question 2 
```{r}
it <- sqldf("SELECT InvoiceID, COUNT(InvoiceLineID) AS item_count, SUM(ItemPrice) AS invoice_total FROM rs GROUP BY InvoiceID")
head(it)
```

# Question 3
```{r}

  it$item_count, 
  it$invoice_total,
  type = "b",
  xlab = "Invoice Items",
  ylab = "Invoice Total Cost"
)
```


```{r}
# Invoices without a discount
full <- sqldf("SELECT InvoiceId, item_count, invoice_total AS invoice_subtotal FROM it WHERE item_count <= 10")
full$invoice_total <- full$invoice_subtotal

# Invoices with a discount 
disc <- sqldf("SELECT InvoiceId, item_count, invoice_total AS invoice_subtotal FROM it WHERE item_count > 10")
disc$invoice_total <- round(disc$invoice_subtotal * .9, 2)
